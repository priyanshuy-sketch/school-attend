# Attendance Storage Feature

## Overview
The faculty page now includes a fully functional attendance tracking system that stores data persistently and reflects it in the weekly report page.

## What Was Added

### 1. Persistent Attendance Storage
- **Location**: Browser's `localStorage` (key: `attendanceData`)
- **Why localStorage?**: Allows data to persist across browser sessions without needing a backend server
- **Data Structure**: Array of attendance records with course, faculty, date, and student information

### 2. Modified Files

#### `course-details.html`
**Changes in `submitAttendance()` function (lines 641-682):**
- Reads existing attendance from `localStorage` instead of JSON file
- Checks if attendance already exists for the same date and course
- Updates existing record if found, otherwise creates new record
- Saves complete attendance data back to `localStorage`
- Includes course code in the attendance record for better reporting

**Key Features:**
```javascript
// Load from localStorage
let attendanceData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('attendanceData') || '[]');

// Check for existing record
const existingIndex = attendanceData.findIndex(
    record => record.date === date && record.course_id === selectedCourse.id
);

// Update or add
if (existingIndex !== -1) {
    attendanceData[existingIndex] = attendanceRecord;
} else {
    attendanceData.push(attendanceRecord);
}

// Save back to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('attendanceData', JSON.stringify(attendanceData));
```

#### `weekly-report.html`
**Changes in `loadData()` function (lines 433-466):**
- Reads attendance data from `localStorage` instead of fetching from JSON file
- Filters attendance records for the current course
- Shows helpful message if no attendance records exist
- Maintains all existing report generation functionality

**Key Features:**
```javascript
// Load from localStorage
attendanceData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('attendanceData') || '[]');

// Filter for current course
attendanceData = attendanceData.filter(record => 
    record.course_id === selectedCourse.id
);

// Show message if empty
if (attendanceData.length === 0) {
    document.getElementById('reportContent').innerHTML = 
        '<div class="no-data">No attendance records found. Please take attendance first.</div>';
}
```

#### `README.md`
**Updated sections:**
- Added localStorage information to Attendance Tracking features
- Added real-time data reflection note to Weekly Reports
- Updated Data Management section to explain localStorage usage
- Added detailed explanation of attendance data structure and how it works
- Clarified that attendance is stored in browser, not in JSON file

## How It Works

### Taking Attendance Flow:
1. Faculty logs in and navigates to a course
2. Clicks "Take Attendance" button
3. Selects date and marks students as present/absent
4. Clicks "Submit Attendance"
5. System saves to `localStorage` with structure:
   ```json
   {
     "id": timestamp,
     "course_id": 1,
     "course_name": "Course Name",
     "course_code": "CS-301",
     "faculty_id": 1,
     "faculty_name": "Faculty Name",
     "date": "2024-01-15",
     "students": [
       {
         "student_id": 1,
         "student_name": "Student Name",
         "roll_number": "ROLL001",
         "status": "present"
       }
     ],
     "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
   }
   ```

### Viewing Reports Flow:
1. Faculty clicks "Weekly Report" from course details
2. System loads attendance from `localStorage`
3. Filters records for current course
4. Populates week selector with available weeks
5. Faculty selects week or custom date range
6. System generates comprehensive report with:
   - Summary statistics
   - Daily breakdown
   - Detailed attendance table
7. Faculty can download as PDF

## Benefits

### ✅ Persistent Storage
- Data survives browser refresh
- Data survives browser close/reopen
- No backend server required

### ✅ Real-time Updates
- Attendance immediately available in reports
- No delay or sync required
- Changes reflect instantly

### ✅ Update Protection
- Taking attendance twice for same date updates existing record
- Prevents duplicate entries
- Maintains data integrity

### ✅ Course Isolation
- Each course's attendance is tracked separately
- Reports only show relevant course data
- No data mixing between courses

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Login** with demo credentials:
   - Email: `sarah.johnson@college.edu`
   - Password: `faculty123`

3. **Take Attendance**:
   - Click on any course card
   - Click "Take Attendance" button
   - Select today's date
   - Mark some students as present/absent
   - Click "Submit Attendance"
   - Verify success message

4. **View Report**:
   - Click "Weekly Report" button
   - Select the current week from dropdown
   - Click "Generate Report"
   - Verify attendance data appears correctly

5. **Test Persistence**:
   - Close the browser completely
   - Reopen and navigate back to the course
   - Click "Weekly Report"
   - Verify attendance data is still there

6. **Test Update**:
   - Take attendance again for the same date
   - Change some student statuses
   - Submit
   - View report and verify data was updated (not duplicated)

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- localStorage API (all browsers since 2010)
- ES6 JavaScript features
- JSON parsing

## Limitations

- Data is stored per browser (not synced across devices)
- Clearing browser data will delete attendance records
- No backup mechanism (consider exporting reports regularly)
- Maximum storage typically 5-10MB (sufficient for years of attendance data)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Export/import attendance data as JSON
- Sync to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Backend API integration for multi-device access
- Automatic backup reminders
- Data export to CSV/Excel
- Student-side attendance view
